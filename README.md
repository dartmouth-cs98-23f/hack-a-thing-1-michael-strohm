# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

I built a basic IOS app version of the game Breakout. I wanted to learn Xcode and I had never done anything with the software before so it was a nice introduction.

some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

I did the entire assignment by myself, no partner.

## What you learned

I found it being difficult to understand some of the functions at first because Xcode feels so different than other software ive used before, but after going around a bit I became more familiar with how to do things like collison detection, screen changes. I also learned how to make buttons for interactibility, and overall got to try Xcode for the first time.
